# MOT Bookmarklets

## What is a Bookmarklet?
> "A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. They are stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when user clicks on them. When clicked, bookmarklets can perform a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query from selected text or extracting data from a table."

## What do I do with these files?

1. Open the bookmarklet you wish to use.
2. Scroll down to the `// Copy and paste the data below` section.
3. Copy the text starting with `javascript:` and ending with `()`
4. Go to your favorite browser and make a new bookmark. We like doing this in our Bookmarks Bar but you can do it wherever.
5. Name it whatever you wish.
6. In the `URL` section, paste the code your copied. You need to paste everything from the `javascript:` all the way to the ending `()`.
7. Save the bookmark/bookmarklet.
8. Now you are set to run or use the bookmarklet. Some you need to be on a certain web page to use (like the Facebook ID one needs to be on a Facebook page like https://www.facebook.com/zuck). Navigate to the correct page or, for those that do not need a certain page, just click the bookmark.
9. **WARNING:** Some of these bookmarklets open one or more browser tabs. You may need to **ALLOW POP-UPS** in your web browser to get those tabs to show.
