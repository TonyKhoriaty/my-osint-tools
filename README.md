# Welcome to My OSINT Tools by: My OSINT Training

## What is this place?

In the course of our OSINT work, sometimes we need to make a specific tool that does a thing better/faster/more efficiently than we could do it manually. This is a collection of such things that focus on OSINT tasks.

## So you made OSINT tools and I get them free?

Yup. That pretty much sums it up.

## What do I do if the tools don't work for me?

1. Troubleshoot the issue yourself and submit a "[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" to make the project better!
2. Submit an "[issue](https://github.com/myosintllc/mot-osint-tools/issues)" with DETAILS of what you did, what errors/problems you had, and details about the system you have.
3. Please do not email us with questions about these tools. They are provided "as-is". If you need to understand what one does and the description we provide is not enough for you, try pasting the code into an [AI](https://chatgpt.com/) and asking it "what does this do?"

## Are there limits on what I can do with these tools?

There is a [LICENSE](https://github.com/myosintllc/mot-osint-tools/blob/main/LICENSE) file you should check out for details on what you can do with the tools in here.
